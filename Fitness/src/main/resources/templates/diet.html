            <h1>Learn about calorie counting</h1>
            <p>Calories count when it comes to weight loss, gain, or maintenance.
                If you eat more calories than you burn, then you gain weight.
                For those of us struggling to lose weight or maintain our weight loss,
                it is critical that we have an understanding of how to manage our calories so that we meet our
                short-term
                and long-term goals. Tracking diet and exercise also helps us become more aware of:
            <ul>
                <li>What we eat</li>
                <li>When we eat</li>
                <li>Why we eat</li>
                <li>Portion size</li>
                <li>Nutrients</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col span_1_of_2">
            <h2>What We Eat</h2>
            <p>
                Logging food and beverage intake helps us think about the type of food we eat and how it is prepared. The fact
                that you have to choose one particular food item over another encourages you to become more aware of the calorie
                differences between foods prepared in different ways. For example, 3 oz of roasted chicken breast with skin has
                28 more calories, 4 g more fat, and 1 g less protein than roasted skinless chicken breast. The small amount of
                extra calories might not seem like a big difference, but over time, it adds up. It is similar to what happens
                when you don't fix a leaky faucet. That slow drip over time means a higher water bill.</p>

            <h2>When We Eat</h2>
            <p>
                The best time to log is when you actually consume the food or drink so that you do not have to rely on memory.
                Look at your time entries in your food log. Do you see any timing patterns that seem to help or hinder you from
                meeting your weight goal? Here are some red flags for consuming too many calories:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Skip breakfast and/or lunch, eat a large dinner, and then snack late into the night.</li>
                <li> Time gap of more than 5-6 hours between meals. Your next meal is likely to be higher in calories with a
                    long delay between meals.
                </li>
                <li> Constant grazing - your time-stamps show that you eat or drink calories all day long. Whatâ€™s going on?
                    Eating enough at meals or are you skipping meals?
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="col span_1_of_2">
            <h2>Why We Eat</h2>
            <p>
                In addition to keeping an accurate food log, consider keeping a journal about events that occurred during the day.
                In MyNetDiary, you can use the Notes section on your Dashboard for this purpose. This will help you discover
                if there is a relationship between what happens in your day and your eating habits. In addition,
                look at days whe re your exercise is lower or higher than typical for you. Does your food intake seem to be different
                on those days? Ironically, many of us tend to eat more calories on the days when we have very little activity.
